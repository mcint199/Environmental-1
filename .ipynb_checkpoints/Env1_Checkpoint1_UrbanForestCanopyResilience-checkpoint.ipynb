    "Trees and shrubbery provide several benefits for the community. With increased CO2 emissions and global warming gaining increased concern in the past decades, the protection of the urban forest canopy becomes increasingly important to increase its resilience to climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the world's population now lives in what are considered urban areas, and these account for between 40-70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions (Safford et. al., 2013). Urban forests, a term referring to the trees and shrubbery within a densly populated area, might be helpful in strengthening resilience to climate change (Safford et. al., 2013). Plants are known to utilize atmospheric CO2 in the process of photosynthesis, and so they take away from the excess CO2 emissions brought about by humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will look to model how population density and tree density impact carbon sequestration and storage as well as how they take away from total air pollution, thus adding to resilience against climate change."
